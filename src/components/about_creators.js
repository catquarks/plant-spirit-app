			<h1>About the Creators</h1>
			<p>Plant Spirit App is a collaboration between Béthany, who conducted the fieldwork and research for this project, and Tami, who designed and developed the backend and user interface. They met in 2013 in the city of Bath, where they studied music and collaborated in many recordings and performances.</p>
			<h3>About Béthany</h3>
			<p>Béthany is an intuitive seer with a strong connection to plants and the energies of the land. Currently based in the city of Chicago, her travels have taken her to Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Guatemala, Peru, and California. She is also a musician, meditation instructor, 200-hour certified yoga teacher, and Reiki master. Details about her work can be found on her <a href="http://www.oluminousbeing.com/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
			<h3>About Tami</h3>
			<p>Tami is a <a href="http://comfortcat.xyz" target="_blank">musician</a> and <a href="http://tamarajaton.xyz" target="_blank">web developer</a> in New York City, who has also lived in the U.K. On  good day, you'll likely find her making music, writing apps, drinking way too much coffee, and saying hello to every passing cat. Tami was very glad to take on this project to spread Béthany's work to more people, and hopes that it might help you too.</p>
