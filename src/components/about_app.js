			<h1>What Is Plant Spirit App?</h1>
			<p>Plant Spirit App was created to help you ask for healing energy from plants. The specific plants in this app were chosen by intuitive seer, Reiki master, and friend of all plants, <a href="http://www.oluminousbeing.com/" target="_blank">BÃ©thany</a>.</p>
			<p>When the app "recommends" a plant, you can experience its healing energies and unique resonances with one of these techniques:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Meditation: </strong>People often meditate with each other to reinforce each other's focus and benefit more from the practice. Similarly, you can meditate with a plant. For guided meditations with plants, refer to <a href="http://www.oluminousbeing.com/recordings" target="_blank">these podcasts</a>.</li>
				<li><strong>Picture Gazing: </strong>If you don't know where to find a plant, or are otherwise unable to obtain it, that's okay. You can connect with a plant by focusing on a picture of it. You'll benefit even if it's simply by appreciating its physical beauty.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>What This App Is <em>Not</em></h3>
			<p>This is not a recipe app or meant to advise anyone on medication. In other words, don't eat the plants or make tea from them. If you know from other sources that such would be a conventional use (e.g. Chamomile tea), that's fine -- but it's not the purpose of Plant Spirit App.</p>
