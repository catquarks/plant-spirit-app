# Plant Spirit App - Frontend

Plant Spirit App is a meditation app, which recommends plant species to meditate with depending on how you are feeling. Data is collected by [Béthany](oluminousbeing.com), the only administrator (aside from the developer).

This is the front-end, which is built with React + Redux. You just search for how you're feeling or how you'd like to feel -- and that's it!
